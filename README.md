# Socketer

Socketer is an elegant, yet simple implementation of a Discord gateway WebSocket for user accounts. Written entirely in TypeScript using Bun, it boasts a dependency-free codebase. Socketer manages the entire WebSocket lifecycle, including heartbeating, resuming, and reconnecting, closely mirroring Discord's official implementation (stable release no. 295694). Please note that Bun is required.

## Future Plans

While Socketer is still under development, future updates will introduce additional features and enhanced TypeScript support for `DISPATCH` events. Stay tuned for more improvements.
